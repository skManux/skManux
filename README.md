### Hi there! 👋

Let's introduce myself. 
My real name is **Manuel**. I'm **Italian**, but I also speak **English**. I'm **14** and I **love coding**. I started coding with **Java** and then I expanded my coding knowledges. Now, I'm studying **C#** and **Python**. 

**skManux/skManux** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **Nupped Network** as **Owner & Head-Dev**
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **C#** and **Java**
